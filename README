===================================================================
The API changed with release 0.0.12, 0.1.0, 0.2.0
If you have developped some code using ZMW library
you need to run "scripts/zmw-upgrade.py" to rename some functions
in your programs.
===================================================================

To compile the library : "make"

Top level goals just for take a look :
	- run_circuit   to compile and launch a small logic circuit editor.
	- run_book      to compile and launch a library administrator (ALPHA).
	- run_tests     to compile and launch the widget testing program.
	- run_xml	to compile and launch an XML GUI not using memory!

Makefile goals (at all levels) are :
	- lib      The library
	- exe      All the executables
	- test     Regression test (you need Xvfb, Xnee, eeyes)
	- doc      Create documentation (needs docbook utilities)
	- clean    Remove constructed files and backup
	- dep      Compute dependencies

Other top level goals
	- TAGS	   Compute tags
There is no install goal, it is intented.


If you can not compile the documentation, it is browsable from :
	http://www710.univ-lyon1.fr/~exco/ZMW/zmw
The documentation examples are in "applications/examples" directory.


To configure the compilation process, see "Makefile.config".
The default option is to compile a slow library in order
to have assertions and debug messages.


To compile your own application, add a subdirectory in "applications"
and copy/edit the "circuit/Makefile" for example.


These sources are here to show that zero memory widget are a reality.
They are :
	- not commented
	- not clean
	- not optimized
	- certainly bugged
	- full of misnamed variables and functions
